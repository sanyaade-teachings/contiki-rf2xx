   @defgroup mac_scan MAC scanning system
   @{

   This module provides functions that scan the available channels.
   End nodes and routers scan to look for avaiable networks, while
   coordinator node scans to look for an empty channel to use.

   The coordinator node uses just one channel to establish a network,
   and all nodes on the network use that same channel.  The channel
   can be either a fixed channel (hardcodded)   PAN_CHANNEL (by passing
   PAN_CHANNEL=13, the PAN will operate on channel 13), or the
   coordinator can choose the quietest free channel (by leaving
   PAN_CHANNEL unset.

   The router/end nodes scan all available channels, or, if  
   PAN_CHANNEL is set, only   PAN_CHANNEL will be scanned
   for network nodes.

   Scanning involves the following steps for each channel scanned.
   This is for an end node or router.

   -# Set the radio to the channel being scanned.
   -# Send a beacon request.
   -# Set a timeout timer for   SCANDURATION.
   -# If a beacon is received before the timer expires, save the
     relevent information about the node sending the beacon.
   -# When the timer expires, move on to the next channel.

   The coordinator performs a channel scan, not to look for available
   networks, but to avoid them, and to find the least-noisy channel.
   The coordinator scan measures the noise level on each channel, so
   there is an array of energy measurements, one for each channel.
   Here are the coordinator scan steps:

   -# Set the radio to the channel being scanned.
   -# Send a beacon request.
   -# Set a timeout timer for   SCANDURATION.
   -# If a beacon is received before the timer expires, add 500 noise
      points to the energy measurement for the current channel.
   -# Measure energy as many times as possible in the  
      SCANDURATION window.
   -# When all channels have been scanned, determine which channels
      have the minimum noise.  If more than one channel has minimal
      noise, randomly choose one of these channels to use for the
      network.
